Telco Customer Churn Prediction System Project Overview

Objective:
Develop a predictive model to identify customers at risk of churn in a Telco company, enabling proactive retention strategies and reducing customer attrition.

Key Activities:

Data Collection:

Gathered customer data including demographics, usage patterns, service subscriptions, and churn status from Telco databases.
Ensured data completeness and accuracy for reliable modeling.
Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:

Cleaned the data by handling missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
Standardized numerical features and encoded categorical variables for modeling.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Explored relationships between customer attributes, service usage, and churn status.
Visualized data using histograms, pie charts, and correlation matrices to identify patterns and insights.
Feature Engineering:

Engineered new features such as customer tenure, total charges, and contract duration to improve prediction performance.
Selected relevant features based on correlation analysis and domain knowledge.
Model Building:

Developed classification models using techniques like logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting.
Evaluated model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
Model Evaluation:

Validated models using techniques like cross-validation to assess generalization and robustness.
Tuned hyperparameters to optimize model performance and prevent overfitting.
Deployment:

Deployed the final churn prediction model in a Telco's operational environment for real-time predictions.
Integrated the model into existing customer relationship management (CRM) systems for seamless workflow integration.
Insights and Recommendations:

Provided insights into customer churn drivers and factors influencing attrition.
Offered recommendations for targeted retention strategies, customer engagement initiatives, and product/service enhancements.
